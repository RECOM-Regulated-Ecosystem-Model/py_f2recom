How to create a target diagram with a legend plus changed marker colors 
and circles that show co-located points.

A seventh example of how to create a target diagram given one set of
reference observations and multiple model predictions for the quantity.

This example is a variation on the fourth example (target4) where now a
legend is added, the marker colors are changed, the radii of circles
to draw are specified, and two points are co-located 
(i.e. overly each other). Symbols with transparent faces are used so the 
co-located points can be seen. The list of points are checked for those 
that agree within 1% of each other and reported to the screen.

All functions in the Skill Metrics library are designed to only work with
one-dimensional arrays, e.g. time series of observations at a selected
location. The one-dimensional data are read in as dictionaries via a 
pickle file: ref['data'], pred1['data'], pred2['data'], 
and pred3['data']. The plot is written to a file in Portable Network 
Graphics (PNG) format.

The reference data used in this example are cell concentrations of a
phytoplankton collected from cruise surveys at selected locations and 
time. The model predictions are from three different simulations that
have been space-time interpolated to the location and time of the sample
collection. Details on the contents of the dictionary (once loaded) can 
be obtained by simply executing the following two statements

>> key_to_value_lengths = {k:len(v) for k, v in ref.items()}
>> print key_to_value_lengths
{'units': 6, 'longitude': 57, 'jday': 57, 'date': 57, 'depth': 57, 
'station': 57, 'time': 57, 'latitude': 57, 'data': 57}

    Produce the target diagram

    Label the points and change the axis options. Increase the upper limit
    for the axes, change color and line style of circles. Increase
    the line width of circles. Change color of labels and points. Add a
    legend.

    For an exhaustive list of options to customize your diagram, 
    please call the function at a Python command line:
